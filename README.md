# Sendbird Coding Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

To get started, install the dependencies and fire up the app:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

At this point, the app should be running in development mode and any local modifications you make will be automatically
detected and result in the app to reload.

This boilerplate project is based on TypeScript. If you are not using TypeScript, change .tsx extension to .jsx.

## Submission

To submit your coding challenge:

1. Commit your code to **main** branch
2. Bundle the code and name the bundle file with your first and last name using the git command below.

```bash
git bundle create {firstName}-{lastName}.bundle HEAD main
```

Email the bundle file to us with the subject line "_Sendbird Front-end Coding Challenge_". We will review it and respond
within 1â€“2 business days.

Happy coding!
