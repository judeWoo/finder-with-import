## Getting Started

To get started, install the dependencies and fire up the app:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

## A Valid JSON File

A valid JSON file contains a single-level object. A property key consists of alphanumeric characters, and a dot only as a delimiter. A property value is always a string.

If the format of the imported file is not valid, it shows an error message.
